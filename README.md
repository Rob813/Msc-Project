This repository is for the CNCR MSc project titled ' Modelling humna perception-action coupling and the constraints in grasping using reinforcement learning to explain Gibsonian affordances

Within thjis repository there are:
- Models for the single agent RL environments [zip]
- The final model for the multi agent RL environment [zip]
- x3 Videos of the multi agent RL environment achieving the goal state  [.mp4]
- The hand tracking code (python script) and data (jupyter notebook)    [zip]
- Videos of the hand tracking for the control [zip]
- Videos of the hand tracking for the smaller object [zip]
- Videos of the hand tracking for the larger object [zip]
